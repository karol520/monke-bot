# monke bot
monke bot is an **awful** discord bot written in discord.py  
this project was made purely as a learning exercise so expect a lot of spaghetti code and generally bad coding practices<br />
## Website
monke bot [website](https://karol520.github.io/monke-bot-website/)
## Installation
It works on Python 3.9, so use that I guess

* Install the requirements:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Create a .env file in your bot directory with the following content:
<pre>
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=TOKEN
</pre>

* In the .env file replace TOKEN with your bots token

* Run bot.py and it should work
