# monke bot

monke bot is an **awful** discord bot written in discord.py.  
this project was made purely as a learning exercise so expect a lot of spaghetti code and generally bad coding practices.

## Installation
idk just specify your token in the .env file, make sure you have satisfied the requirements listed in requirements.txt and it **should** run, I think

## Invite link:
If for some ungodly reason you want to invite it to your server, here it is:
